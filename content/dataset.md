All open source datasets used in our challenge are available for downloading within a single online storage [space](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W1yF3_wbndhBikcQjYjp81TnK5-qIBaT). Note that already existing datasets such as the DCLDE datasets have been reorganized and standardized into a same format.

See full table [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oqLLLQUMhFMrG7XGPaU1I7mO8MDIk9-wt0K-pTAN7GY/edit?usp=sharing) (to be inserted in the .md file at some point)
