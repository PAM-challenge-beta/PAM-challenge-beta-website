## User scenario 

The model benchmark produced in this task should provide evidence-based answers to the following user needs:

“What are the two thoughts popping up in my mind right after I got out of the water a new set of recordings ? 
- Is the quality of my data good enough to be exploited ? 
- What is in my data : anything interesting there ?

What kind of tools could I use to speed up the process of exploring new datasets and establishing exhaustive content reports able to inform on the presence of both targeted and noisy data sources ?
“
