# Task 1 - Detecting North Atlantic right whales in different envirionments

The goal of this task is to produce a model that is able to detect North Atlantic right whale (NARW) upcalls accross multiple soundscapes with a reasonable performance. The training dataset is a collection of recordings obtained in the Gulf of Maine and the test dataset are recordings collected in the Emerald Basin. The focus of this task is on the data-preparation and training startegies used for producing robust models on different underwater environments.


The models will be evaluated on how well they generalize to unseen data from other regions. The goal will be to maximize precision / recall and minimize the FPR per hour or recording.
