For this 2024 edition, we choose to answer a single user scenario:

“
I have developed a detection model showing a 99% accuracy and 99 % recall on my study site and my target whale species, recorded during last winter. 
And now, I would like to implement it onboard a mobile platform to monitor the same species year-round over a wider spatial area. Doing so, I will 
NOT have access to the new recorded data at all! Will my model be able to keep the same level of performance ? Is my model choice OK or should I 
transition to another one ?
”

Our two tasks below follow a classical supervised sound event detection task using strong labeling. These tasks aim to challenge and assess the ability 
of models to adapt and perform in varying acoustic environments, reflecting the real-world variability encountered in marine mammal monitoring.
