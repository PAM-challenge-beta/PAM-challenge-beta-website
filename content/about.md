## Context and motivations

The DCLDE community is the place-to-be where the FAIR state-of-the-art of AI models for the detection and classification of marine mammal vocal sounds should be developed. However, DCLDE has not yet fully succeeded in setting up such a benchmarking framework where best performing models could be easily found, reproduced and improved over time. The absence of well-defined reference tasks using standardized metadata, the lack of a single and centralized hosting platform, the difficulty of assessing quantitatively the quality of annotations, are among the reasons explaining this delay.

## Objectives

Our current project aims to overcome our historical backwardness towards the creation of a FAIR benchmarking framework at the scale of our community. Our first objectives have been 
- to draw up a list of general criteria requirements to design a data challenge ;
- to conduct a comparative analysis of ongoing PAM projects sharing our objective ;
- to set up a beta version of the data challenge fitting at best our criteria.
